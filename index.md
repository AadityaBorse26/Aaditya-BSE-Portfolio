# RFID Attendance System
This is an RFID based card reader that will allow one to check in users using RFID-based scanning. The system also uses an LCD screen to tell if users are checked in or not. A log of users that have checked in or out will be tabulated in a website that can be used to measure attendance.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first Milestone was setting up and installing my LCD screen onto the circuit and breadboard and then testing it. The LCD is a small 6 inch by 4 inch bluelight screen that will indicate when users are checked into the database. By connecting each component's pins into the positive or negative rails, I had set up the basic circuit. I then connected the LCD display to the Raspberry Pi in the circuit. To test the LCD display, I had already downloaded the Raspberry Pi OS and the code for the LCD. The code allows me to test the LCD to see if it works or not. I turn on the Raspberry Pi and run the test script. The text is correctly displayed onto the LCD display, which shows that the circuit is wokring as intended.
